# EEM480 - Algorithms and Complexity Assignment 1

This is the first assignment for the EEM480 Algorithms and Complexity course at Eskisehir Technical University.

## Project Description

In this assignment, we have implemented a Java class named `cMatrix` that provides various operations related to matrices. The class allows you to create matrices, fill them with random values, print matrices, mark prime numbers with an asterisk (*), and perform matrix multiplication.
The output in the project was a graph of the durations in milliseconds for the multiplications of randomly generated matrices of 10 different dimensions, such as 10x10, 100x100, and 1000x1000.

## Usage

To use the `cMatrix` class in your Java project, follow these steps:

  1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

  2. Include the `cMatrix.java` file in your project.

  3. Create an instance of the `cMatrix` class as follows:

     ```java
     cMatrix matrix = new cMatrix();
